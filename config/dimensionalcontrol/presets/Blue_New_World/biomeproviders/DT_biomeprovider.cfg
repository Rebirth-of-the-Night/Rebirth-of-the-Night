#I have only added two biomes to each climate. They are examples with not much consideration behind them.
#Potential considerations:
#I highly recommend adding Biomes O Plenty, Traverse, Project: Vibrant Journeys, and any other biome mods if your choosing to fill out this list.
#Including a biome mod does not mean all of it's biomes need be represented. You can pick and choose the ones you like, and where there's overlap simply pick your favorite.
#Regarding P:VJ specifically; I would recommend turning off most of it's world decor and adding them back in more appropriate locations via another mod such as COFH:World or Cave Generator, unless you don't like the look of them in which case leave them.
#Regarding Biomes O Plenty; You do not have to use Biomes O Plenty world type to use it's biomes, though it's biomes may be missing features such as fallen leaves that may need to be re-added. Or not, if you like it better that way. Either way I would recommend against using BoP's world type.
#ANY biome can be added here, including those from other dimensions such as the Twilight Forest or Atum. You need not limit yourself.
#Humidity is merely a suggestion, not a rule. Swampy just guarantees the biome generates close to oceans, so you could add rocky waters or other non-swamp biomes here.
#Personally, I would add swamplands to warm climates and use the cool swampy area for more unique biomes.
